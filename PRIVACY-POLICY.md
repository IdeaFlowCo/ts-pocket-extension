# Privacy Policy for TsPocket - Save to Thoughtstream

*Last updated: June 20, 2025*

## 1. Overview

TsPocket ("we", "our", or "the extension") is a browser extension designed to help you save articles and web content directly to your Thoughtstream account. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently. This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how it is used, and how it is safeguarded.

## 2. Information We Collect and Why

To provide our service, we collect the following types of information:

- **Account Information**: When you connect your account via our authentication provider (Auth0), we collect your **name and email address**. This information is used solely to identify your account and associate saved content with you.

- **Saved Content**: When you choose to save a page, we collect the **URL, page title, and the full text and images of the article**. This is the core function of the extension, allowing a clean, readable version of the content to be stored in your Thoughtstream account.

- **Authentication Tokens**: To maintain a secure connection to your account without requiring you to log in repeatedly, we store encrypted authentication tokens in your browser's local storage.

## 3. Data Sharing and Transfer

We believe in minimizing data sharing. We only share your information with essential third-party services that are critical to the extension's functionality:

- **Thoughtstream/Ideaflow (`prod-api.ideaflow.app`)**: The content you save is sent to your personal Thoughtstream account for storage.
- **Auth0 (`ideaflow.auth0.com`)**: Your account is managed via Auth0 for secure authentication.

We **do not** sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties for marketing, advertising, or any other purpose. **We want to be very clear: we do not track your general browsing history.**

## 4. Chrome Web Store Limited Use Disclosure

Our use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adhere to the [Chrome Web Store User Data Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/user-data-faq#user-data), including its Limited Use requirements. Specifically:

- **Allowed Use**: We only use your data to provide or improve the extension's primary feature (saving articles).
- **Allowed Transfer**: We do not transfer your data, except as necessary for the core feature, to comply with laws, or for security purposes.
- **Prohibited Advertising**: We do not use or transfer your data for serving advertisements.
- **Prohibited Human Interaction**: We do not allow humans to read your data unless we have your explicit consent for specific situations (e.g., technical support), it is required for security, or to comply with applicable laws.

## 5. Data Security

We are committed to securing your data. We implement the following technical measures:

- All communication with our servers and third-party services is encrypted using HTTPS.
- We follow industry-standard OAuth2 (PKCE) protocols for secure authentication.
- Sensitive tokens are stored in the browser's secure local storage.

## 6. Data Retention and Your Rights

Your data is retained for as long as your account is active. You have the following rights regarding your information:

- **Access & Deletion**: You can access and delete your saved content at any time through your Thoughtstream account. You can clear all locally stored data by uninstalling the extension.
- **Contact**: For any questions about your data or to exercise your rights, please contact us at the email address below.

## 7. Children's Privacy
